# Building a Datalake on ADLS
This repo takes a deeper look into access control and data lake configuration. It includes code snippets to demonstrate how various elements of the lake can be provisioned through the RESTful APIs to support LakeOps.

To get started, read the guidance on [Understanding access control and data lake configurations in ADLS Gen2](./Understanding%20access%20control%20and%20data%20lake%20configurations%20in%20ADLS%20Gen2.md)
